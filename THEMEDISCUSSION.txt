3 rules
/****************************/
► Three main rules for interacting with things but they change with the seed. Would need to create about 9 rules for it to be interesting. Rules could be associated with colors or categories. for instance:
  Combat Rules:
    Only like colored guns can kill that colored enemy (IE Blue bullets kill blue dudes)
    Only explosions actually kill enemies. Other damage will just knock them out for a few seconds.
    Enemies Explode on Death
  Item Rules:
    Ammo is now keys. Keys don't exist no more.
    Weapons are much more common, but you can no longer reload.

  Enemy Rules:
    Enemies only move when you move (Superhot)

► Actually 3 Rules. Throw away all we worked for and create some sort of puzzle game that will probably have a decent score

/****************************/
Dice
/****************************/
► Stats of weapons/skills etc are dice based, so 3d8 damage kinda thing.
► Enemies are actual dice. You shoot Dice. Just integrate dice and gambling into as much stuff as possible.
► Slice n' Dice. Melee focused, where enemies are vegetables and they get minced.
